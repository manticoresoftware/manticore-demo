# Manticore GitHub Issue Search

This project showcases a fast, efficient, and enhanced search experience for navigating GitHub issues, pull requests, and comments using Manticore Search as a backend. Enjoy features like advanced filtering, sorting by reactions, and a user-friendly interface that mirrors GitHub's own â€” with the added speed and capabilities of Manticore Search.

## Just run the demo locally

To run the project on your local machine, you need to have Docker installed with the compose plugin. Follow these commands to start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticore-github-issue-search.git
cd manticore-github-issue-search/docker
cp .env.example .env
```

Specify your [github token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) ("Generate your token" -> "classic" -> specify name -> no checkboxes -> "Generate token") in `GITHUB_TOKENS=""` in the `.env` file.

```
docker-compose up
```

After completing these steps, the project should be accessible at [http://localhost/](http://localhost/).

The default port for the server is 80, so if you need to change it, update the `nginx` section in `app/config/app.ini.tpl`.

Remember to set up the necessary variables in the `.env` file before starting. This is where you can add your GITHUB tokens.

## Running Locally Using Backup Data

You can also restore data to search locally using our prepared backup. Download it from [here](https://repo.manticoresearch.com/repository/demo/github-issue-search/backup.tar.gz) and save it to the `docker/containers/manticore` directory. Then, execute the following commands while you're in the `docker` folder:

```bash
pushd containers/manticore
rm -fr backup
tar xzf backup.tar.gz
popd
docker compose down -v
docker compose up
```
This process involves navigating to the directory where the backup is stored, unzipping it after removing any existing backup structures, and then restarting the project with Docker Compose while removing all volumes on shutdown.

## Preparing for Deployment

If you aim to use this project beyond a Manticore Search demo, such as an alternative to GitHub's issue search, there's a method for deploying it on a remote server. First, install [yoda](https://github.com/Muvon/yoda) on your machine and familiarize yourself with its documentation.

#### Setting Up Your GitHub Token

You will need a GitHub token to utilize the GitHub API. Ensure that your token is set in your environment on the user account you're using to deploy.

You should add the `GITHUB_TOKENS` to the remote server's environment. Usually, this can be done by adding it to the `~/.bashrc` file like so:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKENS=...
```
Remember, if you haven't added any tokens, you're limited to 60 requests per hour. That's not a lot for indexing an average repository. If you started the project with Docker Compose before without a token, note that Docker Compose caches it, and you'll need to recreate all containers after making changes by running `docker compose up --force-recreate`.

#### Deployment

For deployment, tweak the `docker/Envfile` with your server details and make sure you have passwordless authentication set up with your SSH key. Then, simply run:

```bash
yoda deploy --env=production
```

#### Setting Up a New Server in 5 Steps

1. Initialize a new server with Rocky Linux 9 as the base OS.
2. Add your server's IP address to the `Envfile`.
3. Run the following command to set up the server:

    ```bash
    yoda setup --host=server-ip
    ```

4. Begin the deployment process with:

    ```bash
    yoda deploy --host=server-ip
    ```

5. You're all set!
